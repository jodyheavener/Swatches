# Swatches 

This simple Sketch 3 plugin will generate a palette of color swatches for you. It works in Sketch 3.2.

Just enter hex values, hit "OK", and it'll generate a 130 x 130 pixel rectangle filled with that color, a name label for you to change, and both hexadecimal and RGB values along the bottom. Pretty simple.

It doesn't do a _whole_ lot, but it's handy for style guides. This project was developed for the folks over at [Pixel Union](https://www.pixelunion.net/).
